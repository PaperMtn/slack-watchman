Monitoring and enumerating Slack for exposed secrets

## About Slack Watchman
<img src="/images/slack_watchman.png" width="500">

Slack Watchman is an application that uses the Slack API to find potentially sensitive data exposed in a Slack workspace, and to enumerate other useful information for red, blue and purple teams.

More information about Slack Watchman can be found [on my blog](https://papermtn.co.uk/slack-watchman-monitoring-slack-workspaces-for-sensitive-information/).

### Features
#### Secrets Detection
<img src="/images/slack_watchman_finding.png" width="500">

Slack Watchman looks for:

- API Keys, Tokens & Service Accounts
  - AWS, Azure, GCP, Google API, Slack (keys & webhooks), Twitter, Facebook, GitHub and more
  - Generic Private keys
  - Access Tokens, Bearer Tokens, Client Secrets, Private Tokens
- Files
    - Certificate files
    - Potentially interesting/malicious/sensitive files (.docm, .xlsm, .zip etc.)
    - Executable files
    - Keychain files
    - Config files for popular services (Terraform, Jenkins, OpenVPN and more)
- Personal Data
    - Leaked passwords
    - Passport numbers, Dates of birth, Social security numbers, National insurance numbers and more
- Financial data
    - Paypal Braintree tokens, Bank card details, IBAN numbers, CUSIP numbers and more

#### Time based searching
You can run Slack Watchman to look for results going back as far as:
- 24 hours
- 7 days
- 30 days
- All time

#### Enumeration

It also enumerates the following:
- User data
    - All users & all admins
- Conversation data
    - All conversations, including externally shared conversations
    - All conversations that include a Slack Canvas (which often contain sensitive or important information)
- Workspace authentication options


This means after one deep scan, you can schedule Slack Watchman to run regularly and only return results from your chosen timeframe.

#### Unauthenticated Probe
<img src="/images/slack_watchman_probe.png" width="500">

You can run Slack Watchman in unauthenticated probe mode to enumerate authentication options and other information on a Workspace. This doesn't need a token, and returns:

- Workspace name
- Workspace ID
- Approved domains (which can create accounts)
- OAuth providers
- SSO auth status
- Two-factor requirements

To run this mode use Slack Watchman with the `--probe` flag and the workspace domain to probe:

```commandline
slack-watchman --probe https://domain.slack.com
```

### Signatures
Slack Watchman uses custom YAML signatures to detect matches in Slack. These signatures are pulled from the central [Watchman Signatures repository](https://github.com/PaperMtn/watchman-signatures). Slack Watchman automatically updates its signature base at runtime to ensure its using the latest signatures to detect secrets.

#### Suppressing Signatures
You can define signatures that you want to disable when running Slack Watchman by adding their IDs to the `disabled_signatures` section of the `watchman.conf` file. For example:

```yaml
slack_watchman:
  token: ...
  cookie: ...
  url: ...
  disabled_signatures:
    - tokens_generic_bearer_tokens
    - tokens_generic_access_tokens
```

You can find the ID of a signature in the individual YAML files in [Watchman Signatures repository](https://github.com/PaperMtn/watchman-signatures).

### Logging

Slack Watchman gives the following logging options:
- Terminal-friendly Stdout
- JSON to Stdout

Slack Watchman defaults to terminal-friendly stdout logging if no option is given. This is designed to be easier for humans to read.

JSON logging is also available, which is perfect for ingesting into a SIEM or other log analysis platforms.

JSON formatted logging can be easily redirected to a file as below:
```commandline
slack-watchman --timeframe a --all --output json >> slack_watchman_log.json 
```

## Authentication Requirements
### Slack API token
To run Slack Watchman, you will need a Slack API OAuth access token. You can do this by creating a simple [Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps).

The app needs to have the following **User Token Scopes** added:
```
channels:read
files:read
groups:read
im:read
links:read
mpim:read
remote_files:read
search:read
team:read
users:read
users:read.email
```
**Note**: User tokens act on behalf of the user who authorises them, so I would suggest you create this app and authorise it using a service account, otherwise the app will have access to your private conversations and chats.

#### App Manifest
Slack apps can be created from JSON manifests which define the details of the application and the scopes to approve. The app manifest for Slack Watchman can be found in [docs/app_manifest.json](/docs/app_manifest.json), you can use this to speed up creating your Slack app.

### Cookie Authentication
Alternatively, Slack Watchman can also authenticate to Slack using a user `d` cookie, which is stored in the browser of each user logged into a workspace.

To use cookie authentication, you will need to provide the `d` cookie, and the URL of the target workspace. Then you will need to use the `--cookie` flag when running Slack Watchman

More information on cookie authentication can be found [on my blog](https://papermtn.co.uk/category/tools/slack-watchman/)
#### Providing tokens
Slack Watchman will first try to get the Slack token (plus the cookie token and URL if selected) from the environment variables 
- `SLACK_WATCHMAN_TOKEN`
- `SLACK_WATCHMAN_COOKIE`
- `SLACK_WATCHMAN_URL`

If this fails it will try to load the token(s) from `.conf` file (see below).

#### watchman.conf file
Configuration options can be passed in a file named `watchman.conf` which must be stored in your home directory. The file should follow the YAML format, and should look like below:
```yaml
slack_watchman:
  token: xoxp-xxxxxxxx
  cookie: xoxd-%2xxxxx
  url: https://xxxxx.slack.com
  disabled_signatures:
    - tokens_generic_bearer_tokens
    - tokens_generic_access_tokens
```
Slack Watchman will look for this file at runtime, and use the configuration options from here. If you are not using cookie auth, leave `cookie` and `url` blank.

If you are having issues with your .conf file, run it through a YAML linter.

An example file is in `docs/example.conf`

**Note**: Cookie and URL values are optional, and not required if not using cookie authentication.

## Installation

The recommended way to install Slack Watchman is via [`pipx`](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/), which installs the app in an isolated environment and makes it available on your system `PATH`:

```bash
pipx install slack-watchman
```

**Alternative: Install via pip**

You can also install Slack Watchman using pip:
```bash
python3 -m pip install slack-watchman
```

**Alternative: Build from Source**

Download the release source files, then from the top-level directory of the repository, run:
```bash
python3 -m pip build
python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall dist/*.whl
```

## Docker Image

Slack Watchman is also available from the Docker hub as a Docker image:

`docker pull papermountain/slack-watchman:latest`

You can then run Slack Watchman in a container, making sure you pass the required environment variables:

```commandline
// help
docker run --rm papermountain/slack-watchman -h

// scan all
docker run --rm -e SLACK_WATCHMAN_TOKEN=xoxp... papermountain/slack-watchman --timeframe a --all --output json
docker run --rm --env-file .env papermountain/slack-watchman --timeframe a --all --output stdout
```

## Usage
Slack Watchman will be installed as a global command, use as follows:
```commandline
usage: slack-watchman [-h] [--timeframe {d,w,m,a}] [--output {json,stdout}] [--version] [--all] [--users] [--channels] [--pii] [--secrets] [--debug] [--verbose] [--cookie] [--probe PROBE_DOMAIN]
